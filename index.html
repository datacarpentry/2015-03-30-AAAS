<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org/>Data Carpentry</a> is an organization with the goal of teaching basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data. The rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. This deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analyzing and sharing data. Data Carpentry teaches the skills that will enable researchers to be more effective and productive, to learners with little to no prior computational experience. 

In particular, as large corpora of text are becoming digitized and broadly available, it is now possible to take a quantitative approach to analyzing text to address questions in public policy, develop guidelines for implementation or assess the effectiveness of policy. As many of the types of data collected for this type of assessment are text-based, in the form of free text responses in surveys, written reports, newspaper articles or a variety of other sources, the ability to conduct text mining and analysis effectively and reproducibly will have an impact on the ability to understand and contribute knowledge to policy making. 
<p>
Data Carpentry workshops are for any researcher who have data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data. We will cover an introduction to R, how to use the tm package to convert text into numbers, and how to analyze and visualize the data in R. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research. 
<p>
<b>Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Before the workshop 
you will need to install R and RStudio. Please see the <a href=https://github.com/datacarpentry/2015-03-30-AAAS/wiki>installation instructions</a> for more details.</b>

<p>
Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills,
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less
time, and with less pain.

  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance, and the classroom will have computers with the software installed). <em> There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</em> Participants are required to abide by Software Carpentry's
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
